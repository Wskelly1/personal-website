  "text": "I am a Division 1 Cross Country and Track Athlete majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science and Chinese language at Duke University.  I also am an undergraduate researcher in the Ferreira Lab, and have worked on differential expression analysis of proteomics data with the help of my P.I. Dr. Leonardo Ferreira and my statistical advisor Professor Edwin Iversen. I am interested in applications of Bayesian statistics, and the intersection of statistics and philosophy. I love listening to music and philosophy podcasts, reading, writing screenplays, and watching good movies. After graduation, I plan on attending graduate school for statistics, and potentially pursuing a PhD. I am also open to getting a job that allows me to utilize my interdisciplinary skills of statistics and computer science, or express my creativity through screenwriting or philosophy.",
